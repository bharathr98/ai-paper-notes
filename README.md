# ai-paper-notes

I use this repository to maintain notes as I go through research papers in ML. My primary interests currently lie in in-context learning (side note - ICL is such a beautiful thing! 😍), and thus the papers I read are going to be very heavy in ICL literature. 

The notes are organised in folders (and for now there is only one - ICL). For each paper I try to answer the following questions in order to help myself understand what is happening
> 1. One-line elevator pitch for what they are trying to do
> 2. Do they build their own model or do they use existing models?
> 3. A 500 word summary of what they are doing in the paper
> 4. Open questions

These questions are meant as a personal guideline, and is expected to evolve as I start taking notes and see how I feel about the usefulness of my notes.
